Penn Course Search is a Chrome extension that allows students to search for courses in the Penn catalog from the comfort of their Chrome toolbar. Our Chrome extension eliminates the need for students to open extra tabs to gather information about a course. Everything they need is conveniently accessible through the pop-up interface.

## How To Use The Extension

The extension is very easy to use! We have two main features on how to search for a course: 1) Quick Highlight Search, 2) Search Tab. Check out our [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDgKrJiaL38) in Youtube to learn more!
